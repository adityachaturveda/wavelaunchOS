# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Review and Approval:** Share this specification with Wavelaunch Studio founders for feedback and approval on UX approach, screen layouts, and component library.

2. **Visual Design Creation:** Create high-fidelity mockups in Figma for the following priority screens:
   - Studio Dashboard (with all widgets)
   - Creator Detail (all tabs)
   - Credential Vault (grid and detail views)
   - AI Deliverable Generator (full flow)
   - External Application Form (mobile-first)

3. **Component Library Setup:** Begin building reusable components in Storybook using shadcn/ui as foundation:
   - Health Score Badge
   - Credential Card
   - Priority Flag
   - Side Panel
   - Action Button Group
   - Status Badge
   - Search Palette

4. **Handoff to Architect:** Once specification is approved, proceed to Frontend Architecture document creation to define:
   - Component architecture and folder structure
   - State management approach (Context API vs Zustand vs Redux)
   - API integration patterns
   - Authentication flow implementation
   - Testing strategy

5. **Accessibility Baseline:** Set up automated accessibility testing tools in development environment:
   - Install axe-core DevTools extension
   - Configure ESLint jsx-a11y plugin
   - Document accessibility testing checklist
