4. Multi-step experience with progress indicator OR single-page form with sticky progress bar. @docs/prd/epic-details.md#epic-2-application-form--data-ingestion

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Depends on Story 2.1 completion for Zod schema; UI work should confirm the shared validation module is generated before wiring fields. @docs/prd/epic-details.md#us21-application-form-schema-design

### Data Models
- UI consumes schema fields generated in Story 2.1 from shared validation package; no additional architecture notes.

### API Specifications
- Submission API will arrive in Story 2.3; UI should mock success handling locally and avoid hitting live endpoints until integration occurs. @docs/prd/epic-details.md#us23-form-submission-api

### Component Specifications
- Use shadcn/ui `Form`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`, and `Checkbox` primitives for consistent styling. [Source: architecture.md#31-shadcnui-integration]
- Progress indicator should follow wireframe tone: light palette, clear step count. @docs/front-end-spec/user-flows.md#flow-4-application-form-submission-external-user

### File Locations
- Public form route files live under `apps/application-form/app/apply/`. [Source: architecture.md#4-project-structure-relevant-parts]
- Shared validation schema expected at `packages/shared/validation/application-form.ts`. @docs/prd/epic-details.md#us21-application-form-schema-design

### Testing Requirements
- Continue running `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` for UI updates. [Source: architecture.md#2-key-architectural-decisions]
- Add component tests for step navigation and validation messages using React Testing Library. @docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#testing-requirements

### Technical Constraints
- Must remain compatible with Next.js App Router and static export of public pages. [Source: architecture.md#2-key-architectural-decisions]
- No authentication guards allowed on public form routes. @docs/prd/epic-details.md#epic-2-application-form--data-ingestion

## Testing

- [ ] Automated: React Testing Library coverage for step transitions and error states. @docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#testing-requirements
- [ ] Manual: Validate form end-to-end on mobile (iPhone 12 viewport) and desktop (1440px). @docs/front-end-spec/accessibility-guidelines.md#touch-targets
- [ ] Visual: Snapshot progress indicator and success page for design QA. @docs/front-end-spec/wireframes-mockups.md#screen-creator-detail
- [ ] UX Smoke: Confirm unauthenticated visitor can load form, complete all steps, see success page. @docs/front-end-spec/user-flows.md#flow-4-application-form-submission-external-user
