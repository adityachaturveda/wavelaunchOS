# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Status

Ready for Dev

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a configured Next.js monorepo with proper workspace structure,
**so that** both the application form and CRM apps can share code and be developed efficiently

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Monorepo created with `/apps/application-form`, `/apps/crm`, `/packages/shared`, `/packages/database`
2. TypeScript strict mode configured
3. Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui installed and configured
4. ESLint and Prettier configured
5. Package.json scripts for dev, build, test created
6. Git repository initialized with proper `.gitignore`

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Scaffold monorepo workspace with required folders (`/apps/application-form`, `/apps/crm`, `/packages/shared`, `/packages/database`) and shared tooling (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Configure pnpm workspaces and root configuration files aligned with monorepo structure (AC: 1) [Document chosen package manager in README]
  - [ ] Ensure README outlines workspace layout for future contributors (AC: 1)
- [ ] Enable TypeScript strict configuration across root and applications (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Update `tsconfig.json` files with `"strict": true` and shared compiler options (AC: 2)
- [ ] Install Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, including base config and component directory wiring (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Run Tailwind initialization, add required PostCSS and config files, and wire into both apps (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Initialize shadcn/ui CLI and commit to `components/ui` directory (AC: 3) [Source: docs/front-end-architecture.md#3-component-library--ui-strategy]
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier with shared rules and scripts (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Extend Next.js recommended lint rules plus project coding standards (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add `.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore` aligned with architecture guidance (AC: 4)
- [ ] Define package.json scripts for development, build, and testing workflows (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add scripts for linting, formatting, and storybook/preview placeholders if required (AC: 5)
- [ ] Initialize Git repository with project-specific `.gitignore` and first commit documenting scaffolding (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Verify repo cleanliness and add initial commit notes covering tooling decisions (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story insights available for this epic (story 1.1 establishes the baseline).

### Data Models
- Story focuses on infrastructure; detailed data modeling is handled in US1.2. Maintain shared package structure to host Prisma schema later. [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#repository-structure-monorepo]

### API Specifications
- No API surface is implemented in this story; ensure placeholders for future API routes in each app to align with monolithic Next.js approach. [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#service-architecture]

### Component Specifications
- Prepare `components/ui/` to host shadcn/ui primitives with Tailwind styling, matching architecture expectations for reusable UI components. [Source: docs/front-end-architecture.md#3-component-library--ui-strategy]

### File Locations
- Monorepo layout must include `/apps/application-form`, `/apps/crm`, `/packages/shared`, `/packages/database`. Shared utilities and schemas reside in `packages`. [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#repository-structure-monorepo]
- Place shadcn/ui components under `components/ui/` per architecture guidance. [Source: docs/front-end-architecture.md#3-component-library--ui-strategy]
- Adopt pnpm as the workspace package manager and document scripts/usage in the root README for consistency.

### Testing Requirements
- Establish baseline Jest + React Testing Library setup and ensure scripts exist even if tests are placeholders now. [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#testing-requirements]
- Enforce linting and formatting as part of CI-ready scripts aligned with technical assumptions. [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#testing-requirements]

### Technical Constraints
- Use Next.js 14 (App Router) with React 18, Tailwind CSS 3+, shadcn/ui components, and Prisma ORM per architecture decisions. [Source: docs/front-end-architecture.md#2-key-architectural-decisions]
- Configure NextAuth.js scaffolding placeholders for upcoming authentication stories; document environment variables in README for future tasks. [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#authentication--authorization]

#### Testing
- Unit tests: validate workspace configuration utilities and Tailwind setup scripts with Jest + React Testing Library. [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#testing-requirements]
- Integration readiness: ensure lint/test scripts execute without errors and run in CI once implemented. [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md#testing-requirements]

## Testing

- [ ] Run `pnpm lint` to validate lint configuration executes cleanly
- [ ] Run `pnpm test -- --watch=false` (or equivalent) to verify Jest setup succeeds
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` to ensure TypeScript strict compilation passes with baseline project
- [ ] Execute `pnpm shadcn-ui help` (or first component add) to confirm CLI wiring for shadcn/ui and Tailwind succeeds
