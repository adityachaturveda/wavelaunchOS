# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* Consolidate all creator and brand data into a single, secure, centralized platform
* Eliminate manual spreadsheet dependency and scattered tool usage across the organization
* Implement robust security for sensitive credentials and operational data with full audit trails
* Enable 80% automation of deliverable and report generation through AI-powered tools
* Provide real-time visibility into project health, priorities, and risk indicators through intelligent dashboards
* Reduce founder administrative burden to free up strategic focus time
* Establish the foundation for scalable creator brand lifecycle management

## Background Context

Wavelaunch Studio currently manages creator brands and operational data across fragmented platforms including spreadsheets, Notion pages, email threads, and WhatsApp conversations. This fragmentation creates security vulnerabilities for sensitive credentials, causes missed milestones and status updates, and forces founders to spend excessive time on manual administrative tasks rather than strategic growth initiatives.

Studio OS addresses these challenges by providing a founder-exclusive web application that serves as the single source of truth for all operational, brand, and creator data. The platform will centralize credential management with encryption, automate document generation using AI, and surface priority items through intelligent dashboards. This MVP focuses exclusively on internal team use, with no client-facing features or external API access.
